# python-data-science-project
Description: This project is part of the Python Project for Data Science course offered by IBM on Coursera. In this project, I assumed the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst working for a startup investment firm. My task is to extract financial data, such as historical share prices and quarterly revenue reports, from various sources using Python libraries and web scraping techniques. The stocks I will be working with are Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop. Once I have collected the data, I will visualize it in a dashboard to identify patterns and trends.
Key Features:
•	Extract financial data using Python libraries and web scraping
•	Visualize data in a dashboard using Plotly
•	Analyze and identify patterns or trends in the data
•	Use Skills Network Labs and Watson Studio for hands-on labs and project development
Libraries used:
•	Yfinance stock API
•	BeautifulSoup
•	Pandas
•	Numpy
•	Plotly
Note: The visualisation files are the PNG files in this repo as the image from plotly library won’t properly render outside the development environment.
